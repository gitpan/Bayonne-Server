Bayonne-Libexec version 0.06
============================

This module is meant for use with GNU Bayonne 2, the voice telephony
application server of the GNU Project.  The Bayonne Server module allows a perl
application to use the integrated Bayonne 2 serverResponse web service to monitor
and control a remote Bayonne server.  This might be used by scripts that perform
system monitoring, web applications that are written in Perl which must invoke
some telephony function (such as dialing contact telephone numbers) through a
Bayonne server, or any other specialized perl application which may wish to use
Bayonne 2 services.

INSTALLATION

To install these modules type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL

DEPENDENCIES

The Server module uses LWP::UserAgent and XML::Simple.
